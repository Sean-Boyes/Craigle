This is the cavern in which you fell into from above. The surrounding rocks have a sprinkling of vines and few small streams of water dripping down.
In a pedestal near where you fell sits a glowing sword.
Near where you fell you see the empty pedestal.
You see thick vines blocking a path to the east.
To the east you see the path revealed after cutting the vines.

Rubber Room
This room is almost completely white, not a spec of dust or dirt tarnishing it. The walls are maybe of rubber, and you swear you can always hear the squeak of a rodent nearby.
In the middle of the room you see a handheld Empty Lantern.

The Chamber
A dark and cold chamber deviod of any life. It has an etheral odor of decay. To the West there dimly shines a purple mirror. The sword seems to want to go towards the mirror, and pulsates faster the closer you are to the mirror. 
On a rock you see a half-full flask of Fuel.
